# SumUp Assignment

## Data Models

This project is designed to analyze business data and uncover key business metrics. 
The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that can inform business decision-making.

### Technologies Used

PostgreSQL: I used PostgreSQL to set up a local database for importing and storing raw data, 
allowing for efficient querying and analysis.

dbt (Data Build Tool): dbt was selected for its modularity and organized framework, 
which facilitates data transformation and ensures maintainable, scalable workflows for transforming 
raw data into meaningful metrics.
